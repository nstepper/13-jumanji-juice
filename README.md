## Installation

To install and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command:

- git clone https://github.com/nstepper/13-jumanji-juice
 
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the command:

- npm install

4. Set up your MySQL database by running the provided `schema.sql` file.

5. Create a `.env` file and provide your MySQL database credentials:

DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_NAME=your-database-name


6. Seed the database with sample data: `npm run seed`

7. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use a tool like Insomnia Core or any API testing tool to interact with the API routes. The available routes include:

- Category routes: `/api/categories`
- Product routes: `/api/products`
- Tag routes: `/api/tags`

Make requests to these routes using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on the database.

## API Routes
The API provides the following routes:

- Category Routes:
  - GET `/api/categories` - Get all categories
  - GET `/api/categories/:id` - Get a single category by ID
  - POST `/api/categories` - Create a new category
  - PUT `/api/categories/:id` - Update a category by ID
  - DELETE `/api/categories/:id` - Delete a category by ID

- Product Routes:
  - GET `/api/products` - Get all products
  - GET `/api/products/:id` - Get a single product by ID
  - POST `/api/products` - Create a new product
  - PUT `/api/products/:id` - Update a product by ID
  - DELETE `/api/products/:id` - Delete a product by ID

- Tag Routes:
  - GET `/api/tags` - Get all tags
  - GET `/api/tags/:id` - Get a single tag by ID
  - POST `/api/tags` - Create a new tag
  - PUT `/api/tags/:id` - Update a tag by ID
